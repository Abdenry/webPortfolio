# My Portfolio Website!

_**What is this?**_

This is a project to help develop my front end dev skills and teach myself at the very least the basics of ~~decent~~ website development. This is the first website I have written by myself so I expect many changes and improvements throughout the development of the site. My goal is to basically have this as an online resume where I can illustrate accomplishments or projects that I have developed solo or as part of a team in a more engaging/interactive format.
