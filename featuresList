Project Portfolio:

TODO:

    1. Create custom gif for landing page
    2. Add resume information to landing page
    	|->	Review as resume information contains sensitive information.
    		|->	Maybe look at detailing a more general overview such as education, working experience and favourite projects?
    		|->	Possibly keep the resumse formal and the website more informal
    			|->	This way I can discuss less relevant information such as hobbies and pastimes to provide a general vibe for personality
    3. Create more projects to place on page:
    	|->	Custom PC case for tucker (Mechanical Design)
    	|-> Custom LED strips with controller (Software Design, Electrical Design, Mechanical Design)
    	|-> CAB320 problem solving AI (Software Design)
    		|->	Not video worthy but maybe just a small blog post?
    	|->
    4. Add navigation path highlighting on navBar

Future Implementations/Changes:

    1. Project Page
    	a. Tags on projects
    	b. Filter to sort projects based on tags
    2. Navigation Bar
    	a. Search Bar to filter for details
    		|->	Maybe later if enough projects warrant the effort to implement it
    3. Review design layout
